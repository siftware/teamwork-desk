# Laravel 5 TeamworkDesk PM API Bridge


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nigelheap/teamwork-desk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nigelheap/teamwork)

This is a simple PHP Client that can connect to the [TeamworkDesk](http://www.teamwork.com) API. This package was developed to be used with [Laravel 5](http://www.laravel.com) but can also be used stand alone as well. I hope this helps you automate and extend TeamworkDesk to integrate even more into your business! Have fun and good luck. :metal:

This fork also includes updates for laravel 5.5 and 5.6


## Installation

Just add this to your `composer.json` and then run `composer update`.

```
"nigelheap/teamwork-desk": "~1.0.*"
```

You can also simply add it like this

```
composer require "nigelheap/teamwork-desk:~1.0.*"
```

## Laravel Setup

This wrapper comes with support for `Laravel 5`. This includes a service provider as well as a facade for easy access.
Once this package is pulled into your project just add this to your `config/app.php` file.
```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    'NigelHeap\TeamworkDesk\TeamworkDeskServiceProvider',
],
```

and then add the facade to your `aliases` array

```php
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'TeamworkDesk' => 'NigelHeap\TeamworkDesk\Facades\TeamworkDesk',
],
```

### Configuration

If you are using Laravel then add a `teamwork` array to your `config/services.php` file

```php
...
'teamwork-desk' => [
    'key'  => 'YourSecretKey',
    'url'  => 'YourTeamworkDeskUrl'
],
```

### Use

If you are using the Facade with Laravel youc an easily access TeamworkDesk like this

```php
TeamworkDesk::people()->all();
```

If you want to use dependency injection to make your application easy to test the Service Provider binds `NigelHeap\TeamworkDesk\Factory`. Here is an example of how to use it with dependency injection

```php
Route::get('/test', function(NigelHeap\TeamworkDesk\Factory $teamwork) {
   $customers = $teamwork->customers()->all();
});
```

## Configuration Without Laravel

If you are not using Laravel you can instantiate the class like this

```php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

use GuzzleHttp\Client as Guzzle;
use NigelHeap\TeamworkDesk\Client;
use NigelHeap\TeamworkDesk\Factory as TeamworkDesk;

$client     = new Client(new Guzzle, 'YourSecretKey', 'YourTeamworkDeskUrl');
$teamwork   = new TeamworkDesk($client);
```

You are ready to go now!

## Examples

Not all of the TeamworkDesk API is supported yet but there is still a lot you can do! Below are some examples of how you can access Projects, Companies, and more. To work with a specific Object pass in the ID to perform actions on it. Data can be passed through for creating and editing.

**To see more examples [visit the docs](http://nigelheap.github.io/teamwork-desk/)**

```php

// get the latest activity on a project
$teamwork->customers($customerId)->find();
```
